# Reimplementation of DL arrhythmia detector (Hannun et al 2019) in PyTorch
[`Cardiologist-level arrhythmia detection and classification in ambulatory electrocardiograms using a deep neural network`](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30617320/)

Model code is provided. It currently uses a Seq2Seq approach; works with variable length inputs and outputs a tensor scaled down by 2^8.
